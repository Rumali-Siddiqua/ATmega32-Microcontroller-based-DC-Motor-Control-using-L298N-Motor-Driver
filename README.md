# ATmega32-Microcontroller-based-DC-Motor-Control-using-L298N-Motor-Driver
In this project using an ATmega32 microcontroller and an L298 motor driver, developed an integrated system that controls the speed and direction of a DC motor. In CodeVision AVR, the code was written in the language Embedded C. There will be one switch for making input for change in the direction of rotation. If pressed once
direction will reverse from the present direction. Next press will cause again reverse in direction. The
second switch is for increasing speed. If pressed once speed will increase by a small amount, further
pressing will cause further increase in steps. Similarly there will be third switch for speed decrease.
