In this project there will be one switch for making input for change in the direction of rotation. If pressed once
direction will reverse from the present direction. Next press will cause again reverse in direction. The
second switch is for increasing speed. If pressed once speed will increase by a small amount, further
pressing will cause further increase in steps. Similarly there will be third switch for speed decrease.
